              <p>
                As Any Kinda People's lead guitarist, David brings over two
                decades of musical expertise, crafting the intricate melodies
                and soulful solos that define the band's core sound. His guitar
                work provides both the emotional heart and structural foundation
                of their music.
              </p>
              <p>
                Originally from Brazil, His distinctive style represents a mix
                of classic R&B and modern neo-soul, creating a sound that

              </p>
              <p>

                of timing and dynamics; knowing precisely when to command
                attention with a powerful solo or when to support the ensemble
                with subtle, textured rhythms. This thoughtful approach to
                performance makes him not just a skilled guitarist, but a
                genuine musical storyteller.

                Gareth provides the rhythmic foundation and infectious grooves
                that drive Any Kinda People's sound forward with precision and
                soul. As a South London native and original soul-boy drummer, he
                brings authentic feel and timeless rhythmic sensibilities to the
                band's musical foundation.
              </p>
              <p>
                Drawing from a rich tapestry of influences including classic
                soul grooves, sophisticated acid jazz, and recent urban samba
                experiences, Gareth creates a unique rhythmic blend that is both
                danceable and musically sophisticated. This diverse background
                allows him to navigate various styles with natural fluency.
